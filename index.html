When we undergo what we do, something about who we are is revealed, something that delineates the ties we have to others, that shows us that these ties constitute what we are, ties or bonds that compose us. (Judith Butler, <i>Precarious Life</i>, pg 22)<p>
Thinking about libertarians forgetting about being vulnerable and beholden to others, about the team sport that is living. A babe needs a mom. My great grandma needs my aunt to bring the groceries, needs the dogs to talk to. I need a job from someone. You need another person’s voice to dance with. <p>
I am so seemingly obviously I. I am also bananas, I eat a billion of them and they form me. Insane how the non-living virus creates a microbiological relationship with each of us, forming new combinations. There’s also combinations where the virus is not there. Where Someone In Particular is not there. Who are we again? Can’t wait for some other me to see some other you.
