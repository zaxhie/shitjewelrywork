	<p>a few nights ago I read <b>ANTIGONE</b>, the exxtremely tragic greek play. this lady, the titular ANTIGONE is a recent fav feminist icon of mine.
		her brothers killed each other during some conflict or something, and the latest ruler, KREON (rendered exquisitely/monstrously tr*mp-like by the
		wonderful brilliant ANNE CARSON) decrees with his big boy big balls blue lives matter complex that one of the brothers will be honored—
		the other ritually/religiously left for the vultures, for being part of <i>The Other Team.</i> KREON, some "representative" of "the people" and
		"therefore" legitimized as a "law" "maker," says that giving the "bad brother" a decent burial will automatically result in EXECUTION.
<p>ANTIGONE is like "Dam, the gods will not abide by my bro being done dirty like this," so she sneaks past the supremely idiotic guards to bury
	her long lost brother up... and then she gets caught! KREON interrogates her and this Queen is totally unapologetic. And she lets him know that <b>
	laws that are fucked up must be disobeyed</b>... All this dumbass gets out of the conversation is How Humiliated He is by a Woman. <p>He executes ANTIGONE,
	whose last words are "I was caught/in an act/of perfect/piety".
	<p>the nice lil moral of the story i glean is Do Not Assume that the Lawmakers, the Order-Planners, the Architects implicitly represent you. <p><b>No one, nothing represents you, besides yourself</b>.
	<p>fuck the "system"—it only cares about having the biggest balls, about <b>maintaining order</b>—this order is whack! okay in the name of yeezus krist amen
