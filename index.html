<p>I'm cheering for you. I'm scared and upset but the sequential-going quality of time would imply that
I won't necessarily be scared and upset later. Which helps a lil. Someone ~saved my life this week with $20

Last night I saw a helpless gas station worker kick out a helpless man with no shoes trying to wash the burns on his hands. Where are the public sinks. One could take everything very calmly and successfully in a bad way.
I saw another helpless man laying down on the grass next to a crutch and I wondered how he ought to be remembered if at all, or if he straight up murió.
Where’s the day to seize.
